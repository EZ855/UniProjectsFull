Happy path 2:
1. Registers successfully
2. Creates new game successfully
3. Updates quiz's thumbnail, name and adds four new questions successfully
4. Updates question's thumbnail, video URL, name, time limit, points, question type, edits a default question, deletes the other and adds an incorrect answer.
5. Starts and stops the quiz successfully
6. Logs out successfully
7. Logs back in successfully

My reasoning for this choice of path is imitating a teacher/admin who wants to create a quiz for the first time and making sure everything along that path works.

Make sure to have frontend and (fresh) backend servers running before running npm run tests!!
