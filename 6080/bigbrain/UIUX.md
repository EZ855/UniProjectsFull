Our implementation of BigBrain has a simple and intuitive design. It is very human.
- All text inputs have the option to press enter to submit.
- We use grids to improve the alignment of elements and to make the page look more organised and professional (e.g. on the login/register screens and for quizzes on the dashboard).
- We use consistent and readable fonts, and there is a clear hierarchy to indicate important sections of the page (e.g. the name of the site is large on the login screen, followed by a smaller heading "login" - indicating the purpose of the page - then followed by an even smaller "not a member?"). 
- We used contrasting colours to make certain elements stand out on the page.
- We use spacing on pages to draw attention to the important content on the page. For example, on the login screen, the user input fields are focused on the centre of the page.
- We make use of various elements of visual hierarchy to highlight important sections of the page (list examples). For example, on the dashboard the important content is spaced towards the centre, whereas the less important content (the navbar) is small in size, involves a lot of repetition and spans the length of the window.
- We use explicit affordances to make it obvious to the users the interactions they can perform (e.g. red logout button with clear label that communicates the action it performs).
