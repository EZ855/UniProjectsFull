Perceivability
- We made sure that all the text on the screen is legible and has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
- Images and videos that the admin uploads for the quizzes is accompanied with alt text relating to the question.
- All icons used also have an associated alt tag describing its use, so screen readers can pass the info to those with impaired vision.

Operability
- All text inputs have the option to press enter to submit.
- Users can jump between ALL interactive elements using Tab. We added this extra functionality to elements like the text on the navbar.
- We used semantic tags for pages (e.g. header, main).
- Added aria-label attributes for buttons.

Understandability
- The elements on the pages are all predictable and perform functions as expected.
- Input fields have labels so users understand what kind of input is expcted.
- Error messages and notifications have role="alert" and are easy to understand.
- The countdown timer for players has role="timer".

Robustness
- Added roles for interactive elements. For example, sliders have role="slider" to indicate to assistive technologies that the element is a slider.
- We ensured that only relevant attributes were added to tags.
