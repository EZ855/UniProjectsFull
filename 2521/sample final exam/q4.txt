Question 4

(a) How many words are stored in this trie?
11


(b) Which nodes would be visited in searching for "deeds"?
only the 'd' node in the first level.
Children nodes are accessed via the letters (e.g. node.child[c], where c is a character in the word
being searched) so therefore when a node.child[e] is found to not exist, the search terminates.


(c) What new nodes would be created if the word "bogus" was added to the trie?
    Justify your answer.
    'u' and 's' underneath 'bog'


(d) What new nodes would be created if the word "do" was added to the trie?
    Justify your answer.
    no new nodes, the 'o' node would be marked as an ending node.
