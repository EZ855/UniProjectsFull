Question 3

(a) 
(a1) What value(s) would be stored in the root node of the above 2-3-4 
     tree after the insertion of the value 8? 
     Justify your answer.
     12, 35, 60. The 8 will be inserted into the leftmost node and since it isn't full, nothing else
     will happen.



(a2) What value(s) would be stored in the node that now contains 8? 
     Justify your answer.
     1, 7, 8.


(b) 
(b1) What value(s) would be stored in the root node of the above 2-3-4 
     tree after the insertion of the value 50? 
     Justify your answer.
     50 will be inserted into the 3rd child node of the root node, which is full. The 44 will then be promoted
     to the root node, which is also full. The 35 will be promoted to be the new root node.
     Therefore, only 35 will be stored in the root node after 50 is inserted.


(b2) What value(s) would be stored in the node that now contains 50? 
     Justify your answer.
     50 and 57. From the original node, 36 is split to become it's own node and the 44 will be promoted,
     leaving 50 and 57.
