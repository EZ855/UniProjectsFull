Question 5

(a) What is the difference between an Euler path and a Hamilton path?
Hamiltonian path is a simple path connecting all vertices once.
Euler path is a simple path utilising all edges once.


(b) Does the graph have any Euler paths? If so, give one of them. If not, explain why.
no, as there is only one vertex with an odd degree


(c) Does the graph have any Hamilton paths? If so, give one of them. If not, explain why.
yes, 0, 1, 2, 3.
