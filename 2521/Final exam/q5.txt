Question 5

(a) Describe and justify the steps you would take to determine which
    sorting algorithm the program uses.
    Selection sort will always run in O(n^2) time and randomized quicksort will run in 
    O(n*logn) time on average (due to the random pivot). Therefore I would give the executable two lists
    sorted randomly with 10,000 items and 100,000 items. If the time taken grows in n^2 time it will be
    selection sort. If it is smaller, it would be randomized quicksort.
    Randomized quicksort may not be stable as well, so I would also look at the sorted list to see if it
    changes between identical sortings.


(b) Is the sorting algorithm that the program uses stable? How confident
    are you in your conclusion? Explain your answer.
    Yes it is stable since the second number identifies the original order for all numbers, which were
    preserved. Very confident lol.
