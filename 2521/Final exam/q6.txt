Question 6

Which of the data structures is most suitable? Justify your answer.
You must use time complexities as a basis for your justification.

Ordered linked list:
Push -> O(n)
Pop -> O(1)
PrintInOrder -> O(n)

Ordered array:
Push -> O(n)
Pop -> O(n)
PrintInOrder -> O(n)

AVL tree:
Push -> O(logn)
Pop -> O(logn)
PrintInOrder -> O(n)

Hash table (using double hashing):
Push -> O(1/alpha *log(1/(1 - alpha))), where alpha = M/N (i.e. load)
Pop -> O(1/alpha *log(1/(1 - alpha)))
PrintInOrder -> O(n^2)

Max Heap:
Push -> O(logn)
Pop -> O(logn)
PrintInOrder -> O(n)

Therefore either a max heap or AVL tree can be used.
