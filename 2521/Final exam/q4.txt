Question 4

Which of the given algorithms could have been used to construct the
mininum spanning tree? Justify your answer.

Not DFS since each added edge would need to already be connected to a node in the MST.
Not Dijkstra's for the above reason.
Not Prim's for the above reason as well.

Therefore it can only be Kruskal's algorithm.
