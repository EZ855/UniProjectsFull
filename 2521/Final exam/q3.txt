Question 3

(a) Which of the given sequences (A, B, C or D) would be produced by a
    valid post-order traversal of the same tree? Explain your answer.
    Only B. Pre order traversal is NLR and post order is LRN. Therefore since the 2, 7 and 8 sub-tree
    looks like this:
        7
       2 8
    the sequence should start off with 2, 8, 7 which is only B.


(b)

Value in the root node: 36

Value in the left child (of the root): 32

Value in the right child (of the root): 39

(c)

i.  Value(s) in the root node: 20

ii. Value(s) in the node that now contains 62: 35, 60, 62
