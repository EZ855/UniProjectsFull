Question 7

(a) How many items are examined in searching for the key 42? Justify
    your answer.
    42 will be stored in the key value 9. The values before 42 will be 9, 20 and 31.
    Therefore it will be 4, since 42 will be examined as well as the above three.


(b) How many items are examined in searching for the key 111? Justify
    your answer.
    111 will be stored in the key value 1. It will search all the key values in 1 since
    111 is not stored. The numbers will be 1, 12, 23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 78, 89 and 100.
    Therefore 10 items will be examined, excluding the NULL item at the end of the list.


(c) What is the worst-case search cost after N total items have been
    inserted? Justify your answer.
    Worst case, the key being searched will have around n/10 items stored. If the item is at the end
    of the list, the worst case would therefore be O(n/10).
