Question 8

Which of the given statements about tries (A, B, C or D) is false?
Briefly explain why the statement you selected is false.

B -> a word can be a prefix for another word. If for example, 'bog' was inserted and then
'bogus' was inserted, the 'g' would remain as an ending letter and 'us' would be added to
the end of 'bog' with the 's' becoming an ending letter.
