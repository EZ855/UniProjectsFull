Question 2

Explain why the compilation error occurred and briefly describe how it
can be fixed.

Since the current program is using a graph ADT, it doesn't have access to what the structure
of 'g' actually is. Instead, they should be using a provided function in the header file "Graph.h" (e.g.
an insert edge function).
