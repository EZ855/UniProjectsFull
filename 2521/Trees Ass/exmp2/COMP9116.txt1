comp9116 software system development using the b-method and b-toolkit the b-method is a rigorous mathematically based method for the development of reliable software the method covers the complete software cycle from requirement s analysis through specification design implementation testing maintenance and re-use the b-method is supported by the b-toolkit a collection tools of that provide for specification animation proof obligation generation theorem proving configuration management code generation and documentation the b-method uses similar mathematical notation to z but does not use z specifications are given in amn abstract machine notation which is a small abstract programmin g language the b-method is object based in the sense that systems of machines use a number of different forms of inheritance to control visibility and inherit operations there is no dependence on a particular programming language but the current code generator generates c this course will explore the use of the b-method and the b-toolkit the topics covered will include the abstract machine notation machine composition refinement implementation the method of presentation will use case studies to present the method laboratory exercises to use the tools a major project to apply all aspects of the method and use of the tools
