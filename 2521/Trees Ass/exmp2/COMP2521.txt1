comp2521 data structures and algorithms the goal of this course is to deepen students' understanding of data structures and algorithms and how these can be employed effectively in the design of software systems we anticipate that it will generally be taken in the second year of a program but since its only pre-requisite is comp1511 is it possible to take it in first year it is an important course in covering a range of core data structures and algorithms that will be used in context in later courses topics an introduction the structure analysis and usage of a range of fundamental data types and the core algorithms that operate on them including algorithm analysis sorting searching trees graphs files algorithmic strategies analysis and measurement of programs labs and programming assignments in c using a range of unix tools
