comp2111 system modelling and design this course introduces rigorous and formal methods for modelling system behaviour these methods support the modelling of abstract specifications and the refinement of abstract specifications through to concrete implementations consistency of formal development is verified by proof obligations and formal proof the course will cover specification refinement implementation proof obligations and proof it re-inforces and builds on prerequisite knowledge from math1081 especially set theory and predicate logic the course will use case-studies and assignments to develop competence the methods developed in this course are used in the seng2011 workshops and in safety-critical industrial contexts
