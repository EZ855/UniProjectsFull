comp4511 user interface design and construction this course is a project-based course designed to build on the basic skills acquired in comp3511 &ndash human computer interaction the course addresses the skills and knowledge required in industry to brainstorm design implement and evaluate an application through the user-centred design process because this is an iterative process students will be required to build their interface at least three times starting with a low-fidelity prototype and building to high-fidelity and more complete prototypes by the end of the course students should have a solid understanding of the importance of user-centred design and how it is applied in the industry to design test and build a functioning application the course is built to reflect up-to-date industry practice and methods you would have benefitted from also completing comp2911 which introduces you to object-oriented techniques uml and design patterns whilst you will be coding in this course to build an iteration of your application this is not the focus of the course which remains on design practices and testing of graphical user interfaces
