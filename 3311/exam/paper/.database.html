The database for the exam is concerned with horse racing.
It contains information about race-courses, horses,
jockeys, races, race meetings, etc.
The following ER design gives an overview of this database:

<p>
Note that we did not include attributes in the above diagram;
the goal is simply to show the relationships.
Also, we have not copied the relationship names into the SQL
schemaa exactly as written in the diagram.
The SQL schema below gives all of the implementation details:
</p>
<pre>
create table Horses (
	id          integer,
	name        text not null unique,
	gender      char(1) not null check (gender in ('S','G','M','F')),
	age         integer not null check (age between 2 and 8),
	primary key (id)
);

create table Jockeys (
	id          integer,
	name        text not null unique,
	gender      char(1),
	primary key (id)
);

create table RaceCourses (
	id          integer,
	name        text not null unique,
	city        text not null,
	primary key (id)
);

create table Meetings (
	id          integer,
	run_on      date not null,
	run_at      integer not null references RaceCourses(id),
	primary key (id)
);

create table Races (
	id          integer,
	name        text not null,
	ord         integer check (ord between 1 and 15),
	level       integer not null check (level between 1 and 4),
	prize       integer not null check (prize >= 1000),
	length      integer not null check (length >= 1000),
	part_of     integer not null references Meetings(id),
	primary key (id)
);

create table Runners (
	id          integer,
	horse       integer not null references Horses(id),
	race        integer not null references Races(id),
	jockey      integer not null references Jockeys(id),
	finished    integer check (finished > 0),
	primary key (id)
);
	
</pre>
<p>
Notes on the above schema:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the schema is heavily normalised
<li> a race meeting is a sequence of races held at a particular racecourse on a particular day
<li> the races may be "special" (have their own name), or are simply "Race 1", "Race 2", etc
<li> horse "genders" are Stallion, Gelding, Mare, Filly
<li> all ages and genders of horses can run in all races
<li> a race consists of a number of horses each of which is ridden by a jockey
<li> horses finish the race in a particular order; there are no ties
</ul>
<br>
<p>
The data is coming soon ...
</p>
<!--
<p>
You should familiarise yourself with this schema
before proceeding to solve the queries.
It would also be useful to examine the database contents to ensure
that you understand what all of the data represents.
</p>
<p>
You can create the database by running the commands
</p>
<pre>
createdb property
psql property -f property.dump
</pre>
<p>
The above assumes that (a) your PostgreSQL server is running,
(b) you are in your exam work directory.
