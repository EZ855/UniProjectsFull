# COMP3311 22T3 Final Exam Q7
# Relational Algebra


(A) Proj[a]R

You would have a list of tuples with only the a column from R with no duplicates since its a set not a bag:
 a 
---
 x 
 y 
 z 


(B) Sel[e>d]S

You would only have the first two rows:
 e | d | c
---+---+---
 6 | 9 | a
 7 | 8 | b



(C) R Join S

Natural join would join on the column C because that is the only common attribute. It would join when R.C=S.C and would not duplicate the C column as opposed to a theta join I think:
 a | b | c | e | d
---+---+---+---+---
 x | 1 | a | 6 | 9 
 y | 2 | b | 7 | 8 
 z | 3 | a | 6 | 9 
 x | 4 | b | 7 | 8 
 y | 5 | a | 6 | 9 



(D) R Join[b=e] S
You would have an empty set since b never equals e:




(E) R Div T

You would have a single column a with only x in it:
 a 
---
 x
