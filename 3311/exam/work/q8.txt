# COMP3311 22T3 Final Exam Q8
# Python/Psycopg2 analysis

(A)
Database connects.
Query gets all terms that a student has finished a course in.
For each term, prints the term and executes query 2.
Query 2 finds all the related code, title, uoc and mark for each term (i.e. all course data for that term).

Tot1 is total uoc accumulated.
Tot2 is total uoc multiplied by the mark.

The code then prints out the course code, title and uoc for each course taken by the student in that term (and does this for every term).

Finally the code prints the total uoc*mark divided by total uoc (which is a roundabout way of printing the total cumulative mark of the student, which is not the WAM (e.g. my WAM is 74 but my total cumulative mark could be 800+)


(B)
Whether the student exists.
Whether the student has not finished a term yet.
Whether the student has not taken any courses → divide by zero in the last printf.


(C)
1 for getting all terms
10 for each term.

Therefore 11.


(D)
query = """
select c.code, c.title, c.uoc, e.mark
from   Enrolments e
	join Courses c on (c.id=e.course)
where  e.student = %s
"""
This would produce all course data related to a student. We do not need to execute a query per term.
