# COMP3311 21T3 Final Exam Q10
# BCNF normalization

(A)
ABCDEF, fds = A→BC, D→EF, key = AD



(B)
ABCDEF, fds = A→BC, D→EF, key = AD

solve A→BC
ABC, fds = A→BC, key = A, BCNF

solve D->EF
DEF, fds = D→EF, key = D, BCNF


AD, fds = none, key = AD, BCNF


(C)

ABC table is the student and their PhD choice
DEF is the supervisor and their specialty
AD relates the student to their supervisor
